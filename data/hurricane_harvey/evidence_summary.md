## Causal Evidence Table

| Relation | Direct Phrase (Evidence) | Source (AL092017_Harvey.pdf) |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------|
| **Heavy rain → Flooding** | “Large sections of southeastern Texas received 3 ft or more of rainfall… leading to the extreme rainfall totals in the Houston metro area.” | NOAA Report, p. 7 |
| **Strong wind → Felling of trees** | “Near the initial landfall location in Texas, wind damage was extreme… and extensive tree damage was noted. Approximately 15,000 homes were destroyed in these areas.” | NOAA Report, p. 17 |
| **Flooding → Road disruption** | “The flooding resulted in over 300 road closures and all major thoroughfares including SH 242, SH 105, US 59 and I-45.” | NOAA Report, p. 13 |
| **Flooding → Damage to buildings** | “Over 300,000 structures in that region were flooded, with up to 500,000 cars reported flooded as well.” | NOAA Report, p. 9 |
| **Flooding → Power disruption** | “About 336,000 customers lost power during the hurricane.” | NOAA Report, p. 9 |
| **Flooding → Injuries** | “County first responders completed over 6000 high-water rescues.” | NOAA Report, p. 11 |
| **Flooding → Road Disruption** | “Major lowland flooding occurred… causing Highway 59 to close between Hungerford and El Campo.” | NOAA Report, p. 11 |
| **Felling of trees → Damage to buildings** | “Wind damage was extreme… with extensive tree damage noted” and “approximately 15,000 homes were destroyed in these area.” | NOAA Report, p. 10|
| **Felling of trees → Power disruption** | “Wind damage was extreme… and extensive tree damage was noted… At the peak, roughly 220,000 customers lost power.” | NOAA Report, p. 10|
| **Damage to buildings → Injuries** | “Direct deaths also include casualties resulting from lightning and wind-related events (e.g., collapsing structures).” | NOAA Report, p. 8 |
| **Power disruption → Road disruption** | “Erosion from surge near the Packery Channel caused an interruption to the primary water supply to Port Aransas for six days.” | NOAA Report, p. 10 |
| **Road disruption → Injuries** | “About 35 additional deaths are ascribed to indirect causes, such as electrocution, motor-vehicle crashes and isolation from necessary medical services.” | NOAA Report, p. 8 |
